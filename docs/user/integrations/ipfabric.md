!!! note
    All sub-commands are intended to be used with the `/ipfabric` prefix.

IP Fabric uses a concept of snapshots which can include different devices and data. The app supports querying specific snapshots via the `/ipfabric set-snapshot` command. The snapshot is set per user and cached for all future commands. If a snapshot is not set, the commands will default to `$last` unless a specific snapshot id is required.
